# Kongz_movies

Edit the file Kongz_movies.py by entering the working directory name.<br />
The file Kongz_movies.zip should be in the same directory.<br />
Finally, get your Kongz image on Opensea and save it as "input_image.png" in the same directory.<br />
Then run the .py script.<br />
There might be some traits combination which I didn't think of that don't offer a proper rendering.<br />
You are free to edit and use the code as you wish, as long as you do not commercialize it.<br />
